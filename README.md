1. A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale

We aim to capture data surrounding tornado activity in the United States in 2023. We are interested in this topic given the growing concern about climate change. We are interested in better understanding the impact of tornados.

2. A link to your dataset(s) and a screenshot of the metadata, if it exists.

Our dataset can be found in the "raw_data" folder of this repository.
